    content: `Homeownership is the dearest dream of every Indian. It is not just an investment, but an emotional achievement indicating stability, security, and success. In current fast urbanizing India, where property prices are skyrocketing, however, it is vital to have a realistic perception of how much income one needs to have in order to be able to purchase a house. In this in-depth guide, we shall examine the diverse parameters that go into making a house affordable to you in India so that you can devise your financial path towards homeownership.

Understanding Home Affordability
Before we look at numbers, let's know what affordability actually is when it comes to home ownership. One guideline used around the world is the 28/36 rule:
• At most, 28% of your monthly income can be used in housing charges (EMIs).
• Not more than 36% of your income should be used to pay for all your debts collectively.
In India, typically, home loan EMIs of 40–50% of your salary are sanctioned by the lenders, depending on your credit score, job security, age, and existing debts.

Key Factors That Determine Affordability
1. City and Location: The prices of the properties differ significantly between metro cities and tier 2 or tier 3 cities.
2. Loan Tenor and Interest Rate: A longer duration reduces your EMI but increases the interest paid.
3. Down Payment: Indian banks finance 75–90% of the cost of the house.
4. Income Source and Stability: Employees find it simpler to obtain loans compared to freelancers or independent workers.
5. Credit Score: A credit score of over 750 qualifies you for the sanction of a loan and lower interest rates.

How Much Salary Do You Need in Various Indian Cities?
Below is an analysis based on:
• Loan Duration: 20 years
• Interest Rate: ~9%
• Down Payment: 20%
EMI must be around 40% of the monthly income
1. Mumbai (1BHK in Thane/Navi Mumbai) - Property Price: ₹80 lakh, EMI: ₹57,600, Minimum Salary: ₹1.44 lakh/month
2. Delhi NCR (2BHK in Gurgaon/Noida) - Property Price: ₹70 lakh, EMI: ₹50,400, Minimum Salary: ₹1.26 lakh/month
3. Bengaluru (2BHK in Whitefield) - Property Price: ₹65 lakh, EMI: ₹46,800, Minimum Salary: ₹1.17 lakh/month
4. Hyderabad (2BHK in Gachibowli) - Property Value: ₹55 lakh, EMI: ₹39,600, Compulsory Salary: ₹99,000/month
5. Pune (2BHK in Wakad) - Property Price: ₹60 lakh, EMI: ₹43,200, Expected Salary: ₹1.08 lakh/month
6. Tier-2 Cities (Indore, Lucknow, Jaipur) - Property Value: ₹40 lakh, EMI: ₹28,800, Minimum Salary: ₹72,000/month

How Much Should You Save for a Home?
Apart from the down payment, there are:
• Stamp Duty & Registration: 5–7%
• Brokerage & Interior Commission: 1–10%
• Emergency Fund: 3–6 months of EMI
• Attempt to save 25–30% of the total cost. Use it before applying.

Home Purchase on Salary Tips
• Apply the 30x Rule: Take your income and multiply it by 3–5 to estimate a house budget.
• Avoid Taking the Maximum Loan: Never borrow as much as lenders will offer.
• Start Saving Early: SIPs and monthly deposits are your closest friends.
• Joint Loans Help: Combine spouse's income to improve eligibility.
• Find Subsidies: PMAY offers first-time home buyers interest subsidy of up to ₹2.67 lakh.

Rent vs EMI Dilemma
In a city like Hyderabad or Pune, if rent for 2BHK is ₹25,000–₹35,000, it generally makes sense to shift from renting to buying. But in costly metros, renting may be more affordable in the short term.

Rapid Salary Guide by City
City Type                             Avg Home Cost            Required Salary (per month)
Mumbai / Delhi                      ₹70–90 lakh               ₹1.25–₹1.5 lakh
Bengaluru / Pune / Hyderabad     ₹60–₹70 lakh           ₹1–₹1.2 lakh
Tier-2 Cities                        ₹35–₹45 lakh              ₹60,000–₹75,000
Tier-3 Towns                         ₹20–₹30 lakh              ₹40,000–₹55,000

FAQs – Salary & Home Purchase in India
1. Can we buy a home in India on ₹50,000 salary/month? Yes, but your options would be limited to small towns or outskirts of cities.

    When you buy a property, you and the seller must meet at the Registrar of Properties office to have the sale contract registered by law. This process makes it official that the property now belongs to you.

How much are Stamp Duty and registration fees?
Stamp duty and registration fees can vary widely depending on the state or union territory of land purchase. Here are examples of stamp duties, depending on the state: 
    1. Gujarat, 1.00%
    2. Rajasthan, 6.0% 
    3. Uttar Pradesh, 2.0% 
    4. Maharashtra, 6.5%

The actual costs you pay may be higher or less than these percentages based on specific conditions applicable for all home purchases in each state or union territory. For example, first-time homebuyers in Rajasthan buying under a specific cost requirement may qualify for a lower percentage than the normal range of 6.0%. Local or state government incentives charged at lower rates are sometimes used to encourage home buying by first-time buyers or purchasing a below market priced home. 
Fees can vary by state or union territory as well, so do your homework. 

Who pays stamp duty and registration fees?

In India, both the seller and buyer of property are responsible for paying stamp duty and registering your property based on a "deal" you agree on. It can be financially preferable to pay the full up front cost of stamp duty fees if you are the buyer, and an option to negotiate with paper work how much the seller is responsible for. In general, sellers want to finalize their deal as soon as possible if another buyer is interested, but they will appreciate knowing how it all breaks out at the end of the sale. Keep in mind you will have some control on when and how the payments are made after you secure the property.
018 contact information for each state to check local laws. If you are a non-resident or a first time buyer you might not be as aware of local common practices as a local buyer may be. 
Check your locality, but be wary of title or transfer scams pressing time sensitive pressure to sign off. Take the time to have a lawyer review the closing and make sure you know what closing documents are genuine. There is a closing process that establishes that the buyer has formally completed the deal. And depending on the complexity and or price to purchase the property, the lawyer checks everything for you, and then you get rolled common law notice of successful transfer based on closing documents that are valid, and by their review. 

Individual rules within every state 
You must be aware of different types of transfers within your consideration to start your search and have a confident interest based on new property price ranges and individual sales that are similar to you and ideally you see the properties you want are below that price path. 

Where to find property registration fees?
The best place for you to go to get property registration fees for each state each municipality will be through their respective government tax authorities' websites, and the easiest place is by state, and sometimes particular examples help as well to find cases that very claim unique registration rules. 

Understanding registration fee differences across municipalities
Fees and costs may vary slightly or significantly even in the same location, so do your due diligence before committing to a property for purchase and you know - with standard exception of the buyer - what terms are agreed upon!
Make sure the seller is clear on any related costs as property registration costs will vary significantly across municipalities and from one location to the next as well based on time and compete sale amounts. 

Time and wise choices
It may seem overwhelming trying to interpret closing fees and how the government views legislation to get you out of your house as a sale agent only can help you to see you furnished living space that uses undocumented time spent based on where you bought it, and made your choices for your investment as good choices even if you made purposely bad ones too! 
Take care of the seller will focus on the transaction, and remember the hard work to obtain value, and you will be fine and have an increased appreciation of your customer of your newly purchased property.

1. Market price
The stamp duty fees are calculated at a percentage of the value declared by the circle rate (minimum price as declared by the government) or transaction value, whichever is greater.

•	Maharashtra – 5-6%
